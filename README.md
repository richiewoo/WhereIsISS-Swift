# Overview
The goal of this project is to download and display the current position of the International Space Station (ISS) on a map.

1. Download current latitude/longitude from the ISS open API (no authentication is required).
2. Translate the latitude/longitude to a spaceship annotation within a MKMapView (MapKit Framework).
3. Automatically update the annotation every second
4. By tapping on the annotation, the closest city mapping to the latitude/longitude is displayed in a popover.
